# AIM-Lab-Automation

# Stage 1
1. Populate Data on a csv file with random data. The csv file contains 4 Features: Laser Power, Laser Exposure Time, Pressure      and Gas. Each of the 4 features have some ranges except the discrete feature Gas. </br>
   The file is located in AIM-Lab-Automation/initial experiment.ipynb. </br>
   
2. Initially 2 background pictures should be taken: background 1D at 1500 wavenumber and another background at 2700 wavenumber.
   The code is located in AIM-Lab-Automation/Backgrounds.ipynb. </br>
   
3. When these are done, we have to run the experiment to fillup initial G/D ratios of those random datasets. The code is     located in AIM-Lab-Automation/main program.ipynb.
